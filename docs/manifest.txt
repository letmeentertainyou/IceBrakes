*** config files in the root dir ***

A few of these config settings come from a personal project with more modules, 
and so the path corrections may be overkill for the current state of this project 
but they will help if I add modules

/.coveragerc
This file tells pytest --cov which python files I am not testing. This includes __init__.py, 
the tests themselves, lines like 'if __name__ == "__main__":', and 'def main()'.

/.pylintrc
A list of pylint errors I have disabled and some explanations.

/mypy.ini
A whole bunch of settings to make mypy more strict.

/pyproject.toml
Seriously more python path fixes one is for pytest and the other is for mypy's stubgen.

/pyrightconfig.json
This file tells vscode which dirs I don't want linting in. It's mostly for all the cache 
files python likes to generate. This is an attempt to speed up vscode startups.
