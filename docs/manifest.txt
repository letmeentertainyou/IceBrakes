*** config files in the root dir ***

A few of these config settings come from a personal project with more modules, 
and so the path corrections may be overkill for the current state of this project 
but they will help if I add modules. These are formatted different because of the 
longer write ups.


/.coveragerc
This file tells pytest --cov which python files I am not testing. This includes __init__.py, 
the tests themselves, lines like 'if __name__ == "__main__":', and 'def main()' as in my coding 
style these things usually do not need to be on the coverage report.

/.pylintrc
Python paths are weird and even when other tools work fine pylint likes to throw this error E0401 
and I don't like getting imperfect lint scores so I just remove that error. It has no berring on 
whether the code actually resolves my imports correctly.

/mypy.ini
A whole bunch of settings to make mypy way more hardcore. Read the file for more hints.
Add a rule to ignore test_*.py files here.

/pyproject.toml
Seriously more python path fixes one is for pytest (also needed is my path corrections 
in src/__init__.py) and another path fix is for mypy's stubgen. Currently this project doesn't 
have any stubs so this is kind of irrelevant but again it will be nice to have if I add 
a need for stubs.

/pyrightconfig.json
This file tells vscode which dirs I don't want linting in. It's mostly for all the cache 
files python likes to generate. This is an attempt to speed up vscode startups.
