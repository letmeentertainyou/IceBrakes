NOTE: Many of the files that appear in root are sym links to the appropriate location
for that file. Such as docs or src/scripts. This keeps things semi clean while allowing
for import files to be in the root dir. I also made a copy of test_manifest in the 
src/tests dir because it's easier to read it that way while writing tests.

*** config files in the root dir ***

NOTE: A few of these config settings come from a personal project with more modules, 
and so the path corrections may be overkill for the current state of this project 
but they will help if I add modules.


# .coveragerc
This file tells pytest --cov which python files I am not testing. This includes __init__.py, 
the tests themselves, lines like 'if __name__ == "__main__":', and 'def main()' as in my coding 
style these things usually do not need to be on the coverage report.


# .pylintrc
Python paths are weird and even when other tools work fine pylint likes to throw this error E0401 
and I don't like getting imperfect lint scores so I just remove that error. It has no berring on 
whether the code actually resolves my imports correctly.


# mypy.ini
A whole bunch of settings to make mypy way more hardcore. Read the file for more hints.
Add a rule to ignore test_*.py files here.


# pyproject.toml
Seriously more python path fixes one is for pytest (also needed is my path corrections 
in src/__init__.py) and another path fix is for mypy's stubgen. Currently this project doesn't 
have any stubs so this is kind of irrelevant but again it will be nice to have if I add 
a need for stubs.


# pyrightconfig.json
This file tells vscode which dirs I don't want linting in. It's mostly for all the cache 
files python likes to generate. This is an attempt to speed up vscode startups. 


# unifier.sh 
This is an internal tool I use to run pylint/mypy/pytest at once.


# STUBS
This project doesn't have any custom types yet but I will add stubs as soon 
as they are needed.
