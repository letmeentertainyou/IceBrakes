TESTS DOCUMENTED BY NUMBER

Instead of writing a bunch of tests for the existing features, instead write tests
for features that will be written, then turn the tests on when the feature exists.
(Also write tests for existing features too!)

*** means the test is written but the feature is not written.

***** means neither the test nor the feature are written. This is like fantasy football for tests.

# 001
Changing an immutable variable inside if __name__ == __main__ block
# 002
Mutating a variable on a line earlier than the line it's declared immutable on.
# 003
No linting is declared in this test.
# 004 ***
#$ is used at the end of a line but not vars are declared on that line.
# 005 ***
Declaring an immutable var inside a loop. This should be illegal.
# 006 ***
Define an immutable function inside while loop. 
# 007 ***
You can't assign a shallow copy of an immutable var
because in python that can mutate the original. This will be huge mutability safety net.
# 008 ***
On that note you also shouldn't be allowed to change the indivual values in an immutable list
or dict. Of course in python only tuples have that behavior but we are adding it in manually.
# 009 ***
The async recursive assignment test. A couple sins are comitted here.
# 010 ***
Classes baby! This test checks for changes to immutable class vars in class methods, and
properties.
# 011
Added support for +=, -=, //= etc operators.
# 012 ***
Still need support for := operator because it is usually prefaced by something line 'if'.
# 013 *****
What happens if main.py is given a non python file? Either the wrong file extension or non ascii text.
# 999
Cleans up the src/tests/data/tmp dir.
