TESTS DOCUMENTED BY NUMBER

Instead of writing a bunch of tests for the existing features, instead write tests
for features that will be written, then turn the tests on when the feature exists.
(Also write tests for existing features too!)

IceBrakes and pylint have some overlap and you may see pylint disabled for entire
tests because it pops way too many errors. I'll try to make sure white space issues
are addressed before disabling pylint.


*   the test is written but the feature is not written.

**  neither the test nor the feature are written. This is like fantasy football for tests.

*** the test file is being used to develop a complex feature and the final test will be more elaborate.

**** feature is written and test is not

#### LINTING TESTS ####

0000
This test passes the lint, and gives exit code 0.
0001
Changing an immutable variable inside if __name__ == __main__ block
0002
Mutating a variable on a line earlier than the line it's declared immutable on.
0003
No linting is declared in this test. Exit code 2
0004
#$ is used at the end of a line but not vars are declared on that line. Exit code 3.
0005 *
Declaring an immutable var inside a loop. This should be illegal.
0006 *
Define an immutable function inside while loop. 
0007 *
You can't assign a shallow copy of an immutable var because in python that 
can mutate the original. This will be a huge mutability safety net.
0008 *
On that note you also shouldn't be allowed to change the individual values in an immutable list
or dict. Of course in python only tuples have that behavior but we are adding it in manually.
0009 *
The async recursive assignment test. A couple sins are committed here.
0010 *
Classes baby! This test checks for changes to immutable class vars in class methods, and
properties.
0011
Added support for +=, -=, //= etc operators.
0012 *
Still need support for := operator because it is usually prefaced by something like 'if'.
0013
Checks that IceBrakes ignores comments (# only)
0014
First scope test.
0015
More in depth scope test.


#### FILESYSTEM TESTS ####

1000 **
What happens if main.py is given a non python file? Either the wrong file extension or non ascii text.

Start with file extensions, and then see if there is a python way to test if a file is ascii or not.

1001
Use pytest_runner and existing test files to capture and test the expected exit codes.

1002
This is the same as test 0 but with an invalid filename. To test the invalid file name case. 
This test is a bit weird because it requires an invalid name so it actually tries to lint 
test_0###.py which doesn't exist. 


#### BUG FIX TESTS ####
(currently empty)


#### FINAL TEST ####
9999_cleanup
Cleans up the src/tests/data/tmp dir.
