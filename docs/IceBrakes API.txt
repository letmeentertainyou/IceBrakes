# THIS DOCUMENT MIGHT BE OUTDATED SINCE THE LAST CHANGES!!!!
# Double check the function params and returns. At least a few have changed.

EXIT CODES
0: Lint passed
1: Lint failed.
2: No immutables declared.

It turned out to be pretty complicated adding exit code three because
some lines might trigger EC3 and some might trigger EC1. So now any failures
result in EC1 and EC2 is still used for when a lint isn't run at all.
3: Immutable declared on a line but not defined.


GLOBALS

*** DictStrSet = Dict[str, set]
    DictStrSet is a type aliases because the type hint Dict[str, set] occurs a lot in IceBrakes
    while it unlikely for that type to change it is better to be able to change it once at the top
    of the file. This has proven hand as I changed the internal API.


CLASSES 

*** States():

    States.all_mode determines if we are linting for all names in a file or just those on lines ending in #?.

    States.errors is used to track whether the lint failed or passed. And helps with the error codes too.


FUNCTIONS

*** icebrakes(filepath: str) -> None
    The main function of IceBrakes takes a single argument filepath is a string that points to
    a file, assuming filepath is a file, then this function begins linting the file by collecting 
    all named assignments and any references to const variables (#$). Then it runs cross_reference 
    on them which is detailed further down this file.


*** get_names_from_file(file: List[str], target='') -> dict

    This function checks every line of a file and grabs the anything identified as a name
    from those lines. If a target is declared this function checks the last chars of the line
    for the target.

    This can probably be optimized but the logic isn't really going to change. If I add full dir 
    support then this method will be called on every py file in a dir. Error handling would be good too.

    get_names_from_file also houses a subfunction called get_names_from_line which is run on every
    line of the file.

    (support for single line multi name assignments coming soon)


*** paren_parse(line: str) -> str

    paren_parse searches a line for one of these openers ['async def', 'def', 'class'] 
    and if an opener is found then the string between the opener and "(" is returned.

    This captures var names on lines like: 
    def name():
    class name():
    async def name():


*** equal_sign_parse equal_sign_parse(line: str) -> str

    This method parses a string for any single equal sign.
    Once an equal sign is found it gets the first name before the 
    equal sign. 
    
    I also added support for other kinds of assignment like +=, *=, :=. 

    I made ALL_MODE global so it isn't passed around so much. 

    There types of assignment are currently supported.
    x: DictIntStr = {45, '45'}
    x=45, x =45, x= 45 ...etc.


*** cross_reference(constants, all_vars) -> None

    Once you have the constants and all_vars for a given python file you can cross reference them to see if any constants are overwritten illegally and inform the users. This is the main interface our users will interact with.
