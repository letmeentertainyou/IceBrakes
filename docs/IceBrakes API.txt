GLOBALS

*** DictIntStr = Dict[int, str]
    DictIntStr is a type aliases because the type hint Dict[int, str] occurs a lot in icebrakes
    while it unlikely for that type to change it is better to be able to change it once at the top
    of the file.

*** ALL_MODE=False
    This arg was getting passed through like four functions and it made more sense for it to be global.


FUNCTIONS

*** icebrakes(filepath: str) -> None
    The main function of icebrakes takes a single argument filepath is a string that points to
    a file, assuming filepath is a file, then this function begins linting the file by collecting all named assignments and any references to const variables (#$). Then it runs cross_reference on them which is detailed further down this file.


*** get_names_from_file(file: List[str], target='') -> dict

    This function checks every line of a file and grabs the anything idenfitifed as a name
    from those lines. If a target is declared this function checks the last chars of the line
    for the target.

    This can probably be optimized but the logic isn't really going to change. If I add full dir 
    support then this method will be called on every py file in a dir. Error handling would be good too.

    get_names_from_file also houses a subfunction called get_names_from_line which is run on every
    line of the file.

    (support for single line multi name assignments coming soon)


*** paren_parse(line: str) -> str

    paren_parse searches a line for one of these openers ['async def', 'def', 'class'] 
    and if an opener is found then the string between the opener and "(" is returned.

    This captures var names on lines like: 
    def name():
    class name():
    async def name():


*** equal_sign_parse equal_sign_parse(line: str) -> str

    This method parses a string for any single equal sign.
    Once an equal sign is found it gets the first name before the 
    equal sign. 
    
    I also added support for other kinds of assignment like +=, *=, :=. 

    I made ALL_MODE global so it isn't passed around so much. 

    There types of assignment are currently supported.
    x: DictIntStr = {45, '45'}
    x=45, x =45, x= 45 ...etc.


*** cross_referencecross_reference(consts, all_vars) -> None

    Once you have the consts and all_vars for a given python file you can cross reference them to see if any consts are overwritten illegally and inform the users. This is the main interface our users will interact with.
