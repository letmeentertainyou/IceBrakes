# URGENT

Update IceBrakes API.txt with the 0.1.1 changes.

Then update TESTING_README.txt and test_manifest.txt
Some of these tests might involve changes that require additional documentation


# MISSING FEATURES
Implement tests #5-10 and #12 (detailed bellow)

    *Directory support

        IceBrakes should run with either a file or a dir of files as input. I will add
        a bool to get_names_from_file() that tracks when a dir is being parsed. When
        in dir_more we return an exit code instead of exiting with that code. Here is an
        example of the code.

        def get_names_from_file(file: str, dir_mode: bool=False) -> int:
            exit_code: int = 0
            if dir_mode:
                return exit_code
            else:
                exit(exit_code)

        Then the dir function just collects all the exit codes and prints them all
        for now. This won't break a single unit test or the API.


    * Loop awareness

        This is not too different from parsing def/class etc. Basically the rule is just
        "You can never assign an immutable in the body of a loop." So we only care about
        loops when building the constants dict. This error is different because it's an 
        illegal use of "#$" all together. We will give the message "Constant assigned 
        inside of a loop on line ##, consider assigning outside of the loop instead."
        
        We also need a way to track whether or not we're in the body of a loop,
        and I'm not sure of the fastest way to do that yet. The indentation level is already
        being tracked so all we need is a like a "in loop" bool.

        "break" statements are a weird edge case here because I'm not executing or following the
        logic of the code, and I really can't think of a way a break statement would effect
        immutable vars. Instead I'll be concerned only with whitespace for exiting loops. 

        We have to track every single loop in order to know if "#$" is being used inside a loop
        so there isn't really a shortcut here.


    * Assigning a shallow copy to a new name which causes mutation

        I don't think this will be too tricky but it's gonna have a lot of processing overhead
        because before I only cared about name assignments that matched the constants dict and
        after this change I will need to track the values assigned to all names in the file to
        make sure none of the constants are shallow copied to another name. So we might gain an
        an order of magnitude in time.


    * Multiline assignment (weird whitespace hack)

        I just remembered this is legal in python and I have no clue how to parse for it.

        bar: List = [1,
                     2,
                     3,
                     4 ]

        This relates heavily to the topic of shallow copies but it affects all assignments.


    * Lines that end in '\' awareness

        I haven't really thought about this one yet because I think it's going to change a lot
        of my algorithm, I'm not really sure how to approach it. I suppose another boolean in
        States() to track if we are on a multiline is a good start. 
        

   *  String awareness (ignore parsed words in quotes)
        
        This may be my first real use case for regex, I honestly don't know how to
        approach this problem yet but I will think about it after a few more features/docs 
        are done.


    * Multi value assignments (tuple expansion)

        This might take regex too, this one seems the most complicated to me but I just
        need to notate all the edge cases for the comma character in python and then make
        a plan.
