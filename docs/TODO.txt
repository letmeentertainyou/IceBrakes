# MISSING FEATURES

Implement tests #3-10 and #12.
Loop awareness
Scope awareness
Lines that end in '\' awareness
Multi value assignments (tuple expansion)
And other white space anomalies.

Modify IceBrakes algo to ignore names that aren't in the constants
dict. This will skip a large amount of checks, and when more tests
are run things will be way faster. Easy change.


# CHANGELOG
Enabled tests 0000, 0004, 1001
Added exit codes 0, 1, 2
Added States dataclass to remove globals from icebrakes.py
