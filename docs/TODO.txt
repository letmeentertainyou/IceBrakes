# MISSING FEATURES

Implement tests #3-10 and #12.
Loop awareness
Scope awareness
Lines that end in '\' awareness
Multi value assignments (tuple expansion)
And other white space anomalies.




ALGORITHM IMPROVEMENT IDEAS!

These changes will not effect any of the API and therefore any of the tests.
So I will use pytest with our 10 existing tests to time out how much
these improvements speed up testing.

This speedup in the tests will help as I add more and more tests because right now
it takes about 0m0.800s to run the 10 tests I have. I'd like to keep that number low as possible.



*** 
Modify IceBrakes algo to only read each file once. You still build two
dicts for CONSTANTS and ALL_VARS but you do it in one pass.

This will be uglier code in some ways with a bit more nesting and a bit less
DRY potential. 

Our bigO time improvement looks like this:  O(Nᴹ + Nᴹ⁺¹)  ->  O(Nᴹ⁺¹)
Where N is the length of the file and M is the amount of checks I do per line
and the +1 represents the single extra check for #$ at the end of each line.

I'm having real trouble parsing this math because it casts a pretty wide net.
For smaller numbers we are looking at close to 100% speed up or double speed. Hopefully
that works out for my tests but as the size of N and M grow this improvement matters less.


*** 
Modify IceBrakes algo to ignore names that aren't in the constants
dict. This will skip a large amount of checks, and when more tests
are run things will be way faster. Easy change. I have no idea how this would
effect big O time other than that the bigger the constants dict is the less
skips I get. But overall this should other a huge speedup for the tests which only
usually declare one or two #$ anyways. 



# CHANGELOG
