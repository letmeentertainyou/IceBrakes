# MISSING FEATURES
Implement tests #5-10 and #12 (detailed bellow)

    * Loop awareness

        This is not too different from parsing def/class etc. Basically the rule is just
        "You can never assign an immutable in the body of a loop." So we only care about
        loops when building the constants dict. This error is different because it's an 
        illegal use of "#$" all together. We will give the message "Constant assigned 
        inside of a loop on line ##, consider assigning outside of the loop instead."
        
        We also need a way to track whether or not we're in the body of a loop,
        and I'm not sure of the fastest way to do that yet. The indentation level is already
        being tracked so all we need is a like a "in loop" bool.

        "break" statements are a weird edge case here because I'm not executing or following the
        logic of the code, and I really can't think of a way a break statement would effect
        immutable vars. Instead I'll be concerned only with whitespace for exiting loops. 

        We have to track every single loop in order to know if "#$" is being used inside a loop
        so there isn't really a shortcut here.


   *  String awareness (ignore parsed words in quotes)
        
        I have a more detailed writeup of my approach plan in strings.py, writing the multiline
        string parser will be the first step to address most of the below tasks. Multiline and 
        line's ending in \' need the same multiline engine but with different criteria.

        I can write the multiline engine for any of the below work too and backport it to strings
        if I feel more motivated to move that direction. I am enjoying building this project out
        in such a modular way because it's pretty easy to expand so far.


    * Assigning a shallow copy to a new name which causes mutation
        
        I don't think this will be too tricky but it's gonna have a lot of processing overhead
        because before I only cared about name assignments that matched the constants dict and
        after this change I will need to track the values assigned to all names in the file to
        make sure none of the constants are shallow copied to another name. So we might gain an
        an order of magnitude in time.


    * Multiline assignment (weird whitespace hack)

        I just remembered this is legal in python and I have no clue how to parse for it.

            bar: List = [1,
                        2,
                        3,
                        4 ]

        This relates heavily to the topic of shallow copies but it affects all assignments.
        We will basically need to build another dict containing all values that get assigned
        to the right of an equal sign. This will be part of equal_sign_parse and not too much
        new code but it is an entire new dict to keep track of, a bit messy.

            foo     #$
            bar = foo

        That would be always illegal in the simplest approach.


    * Lines that end in '\' awareness

        I haven't really thought about this one yet because I think it's going to change a lot
        of my algorithm, I'm not really sure how to approach it. I suppose another boolean in
        States() to track if we are on a multiline is a good start. 


    * Multi value assignments (tuple expansion)

        This might take regex too, this one seems the most complicated to me but I just
        need to notate all the edge cases for the comma character in python and then make
        a plan. 
        
        The comma parsing engine I will have to build is also potentially part of the new right
        hand of the equal sign dict that I need to start building. I may begin by outlining how 
        the above four features will depend on each other's apis before actually writing the code.
