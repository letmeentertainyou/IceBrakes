My current plan is to get the below features locked in and then start a new project
and actually use IceBrakes as a linter on that project. That will help me find more
edge cases and bugs in IceBrakes. I consider the below features to be required before
that happens. I will probably slow down development of IceBrakes around version 0.2.5.


# MISSING FEATURES

    * String Parser (v0.1.8)
        
        For single line strings we only need to worry about equal_sign_parse() and I think
        it might be abstractly simple in that we only care if ' or " occur before the 
        equal sign.


    * Multiline Comment Engine (v0.2.0)

        Strings are complex enough that I will hand them in two steps. First I'm tackling
        multi line strings which will be a state that needs to update every single pass.


    * Lines that end in '\' awareness (v*.*.*)

        I haven't really thought about this one yet because I think it's going to change a lot
        of my algorithm, I'm not really sure how to approach it. I suppose another boolean in
        States() to track if we are on a multiline is a good start.

        I can't decide if this feature will be simple/complex or if it's even that relevant to
        assignment so this feature is pretty low on my list. I rarely if ever use the line split
        operator.


    # This one is a sloppy writeup
    * Square Brace Checker (this unblocks all the below features)

        if foo is immutable the foo[x] = is illegal. So let's check for that as a type 
        of assignment. This is going to cost a lot of performance but it's fundamental.


    * Shallow Copy Prevention
        
        I don't think this will be too tricky but it's gonna have a lot of processing overhead
        because before I only cared about name assignments that matched the constants dict and
        after this change I will need to track the values assigned to all names in the file to
        make sure none of the constants are shallow copied to another name. So we might gain an
        an order of magnitude in time.


    * Multiline Assignment (weird whitespace hack)

        I just remembered this is legal in python and I have no clue how to parse for it.

            bar: List = [1,
                        2,
                        3,
                        4 ]

        This relates heavily to the topic of shallow copies but it affects all assignments.
        We will basically need to build another dict containing all values that get assigned
        to the right of an equal sign. This will be part of equal_sign_parse and not too much
        new code but it is an entire new dict to keep track of, a bit messy.

            foo     #$
            bar = foo

        That would be always illegal in the simplest approach.


    * Multi value assignments (tuple expansion)

        This might take regex too, this one seems the most complicated to me but I just
        need to notate all the edge cases for the comma character in python and then make
        a plan. 
        
        The comma parsing engine I will have to build is also potentially part of the new right
        hand of the equal sign dict that I need to start building. I may begin by outlining how 
        the above four features will depend on each other's apis before actually writing the code.
