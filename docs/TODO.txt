# MISSING FEATURES

Implement tests #3-10 and #12.
Loop awareness
Scope awareness
Lines that end in '\' awareness
Multi value assignments (tuple expansion)
And other white space anomalies.
Add a changelog somewhere (maybe here?)

Modify icebrakes algo to ignore names that aren't in the constants
dict. This will skip a large amount of checks, and when more tests
are run things will be way faster. Easy change.


# CHANGELOG
Added exit codes 0, 1, 2
Added States dataclass to remove globals from icebrakes.py
