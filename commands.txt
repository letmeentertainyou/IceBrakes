This file is not intended to be executed which is why command lines start with $

Some of these commands were not possible without a hard path so you can change 
"~/Python/Projects" to an appropriate path to the IceBrakes source on your machines.

Many of these commands are presented as an alias because they would not be practical to
type more than once ever.


### NO CATEGORY ###

Build IceBrakes
$ python -m build

Find all Python files by line length
$ find . -name '*.py' | xargs wc -l | sort

Convert all sym links to hard links (stolen from superuser)
$ find -type l -exec bash -c 'ln -f "$(readlink -m "$0")" "$0"' {} \;


### TESTING FAILURE DIAGNOSTIC ###

Toggle the cleanup test off/on.
$ alias cleanup_toggle='~/Python/Projects/IceBrakes/scripts/cleanup_toggle.py'

Diff the expected test output from the generated output. 
testdiff(){
    perm=~/Python/Projects/IceBrakes/src/tests/data/perm/test_$1.txt
    tmp=~/Python/Projects/IceBrakes/src/tests/data/tmp/test_$1.txt
    diff $perm $tmp }


### GIT ###

List all files in git repo.
$ alias gtree='git ls-tree --full-tree --name-only -r HEAD'

Undo last commit.
$ alias greset='git reset --soft HEAD~1'

Add all files and commit.
$ alias g='git add --all && git commit -m $1'

Run pre-commit script in project root from any dir.
$ alias pre='cd ~/Python/Projects/IceBrakes/ && ./scripts/pre-commit && cd -'


### BENCHMARKS ###

I needed a larger python file to get a more realistic time improvement 
for my algo changes (to make me feel better). I found a very large python
file and this is my alias for timing a lint of that file.
$ alias iceT='cd ~/Python/Projects/IceBrakes/src && time ./icebrakes.py benchmark.py.txt && cd -'
